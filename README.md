To ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the project, all team members must follow these coding standards:
- Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow Kotlin best practices, including proper use of val vs var, null safety, and concise syntax.
- Apply consistent indentation (4 spaces) and spacing rules.
- Avoid code duplication — follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## 🌿 Git Branching Strategy

Survey-Core uses a clear Git branching strategy to organize teamwork and ensure safe development:
- main: Stable, production-ready code
- dev: Main development branch
- feature/[name]: For new features
- bugfix/[name]: For fixing bugs
- docs: For documentation updates
- hotfix/[name]: For urgent fixes to production
All changes must go through Pull Requests and be reviewed before merging.
